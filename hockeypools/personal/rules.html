<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>Due to COVID-19, the NHL had to stop mid-season before playoff positions and seeds in each division could be decided as per normal rules.&nbsp; The NHL have since come up with a plan to allow the NHL to return to play, which has been approved, which will allow for the playoff positions and seeds to be decided, and playoffs to occur this season.&nbsp; You can review these rules at the following youtube video: <a class="c18" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCXeGNwovU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCXeGNwovU</a>.</p>

<h2>Point Tally:</h2>
<p>The points tallied during this round are entirely separate from the Playoff portion.&nbsp; Total points will be tallied once all games and matchups are complete.&nbsp; It will be tallied as a sum of points gained in both Seeds 1-4 and Seeds 5-12.&nbsp; This portion is solely for bragging rights, and no monetary value is assigned to Qualifiers.</p>
<h3>Seeds 1-4 - Round Robin</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 points for choosing the correct winner of each game.</li>
<li>4 points for choosing the correct 1st place seed in each conference.</li>
<li>24 points in total for choosing the correct winners in games.</li>
<li>32 points in total available in the round.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Seeds 5-12 - Best of 5 Qualifying Round</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 points for choosing the correct matchup winner.</li>
<li>2 additional points for the correct number of games, if the matchup winner is correct.</li>
<li>16 points in total for choosing only correct teams.</li>
<li>32 points in total available in the round.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tie Breaker:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1st&nbsp;Tie Breaker: Most correct choices for the top seed in each conference.</li>
<li>2nd&nbsp;Tie Breaker: Most correct matchups chosen (Team and # of Games).</li>
<li>3rd Tie Breaker: Most correct matchups chosen (Team)</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above tie breakers are capable of determining a single 1st, 2nd or 3rd, then it goes to the person who is tallest (including hair, but it has to stand up on its own, gel or another thickening agent can be used), barefoot with both of their feet firmly planted entirely on the ground.</p>
<h3>Rewards:</h3>
<p>There will be <strong>no rewards</strong> for the qualifying round due to the completely random nature and unknowns with team performance in training camp, and after the pause.&nbsp; This round is just for fun!</p>
