    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of the playoffs, participants must select the teams who they believe will win each of the best of 7 matchups in the Quarterfinals, and the number of games each team will win the matchup in (4, 5, 6 or 7 games). This will only be done on a per round basis at the beginning of that round (not for the whole bracket). Points for the correct number of games will only be awarded if the team they have chosen wins that matchup. Participants will also select the team that they believe will win the Stanley Cup (Final Round) at the beginning. The chosen Stanley Cup Winner cannot be modified once the playoffs begin, and the Stanley Cup team chosen by each participant to win the playoffs must continue to be chosen by that participant in every matchup they appear, until they are eliminated.</p>
    <p>Once the Quarterfinal round is complete, points will be tallied as per the below and carried forward to the next round. Once the new matchups are determined, participants will then select the teams who they believe will win each of the best of 7 matchups in the Semifinal round, and the number of games they will win the matchup in (4, 5, 6 or 7 games).</p>
    <p>The same format will be followed for the Conference finals, and the Final.</p>
    <p>Once the playoffs (Final round) are complete and the Stanley Cup winner is known, the sum of points for each participant from each round, and points for the correct Stanley Cup team will be tallied. Participants will be awarded as per the rewards below.</p>
    <p>*** If you do not submit your picks for each round before the puck drops in the first game of each round, you will be disqualified with no reimbursement ***</p>
